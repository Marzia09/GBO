# GBO (Gooseneck Barnacle Optimization Algorithm)
# Python Implementation (You can also request MATLAB Implementation)

This repository provides a standalone Python implementation of the Gooseneck Barnacle Optimization (GBO) algorithm, a nature-inspired metaheuristic developed based on the reproductive behaviors of stalked barnacles. GBO is designed to solve complex optimization problems involving continuous, nonlinear, and multimodal functions.

## üîç Description

GBO simulates the unique mating strategies of gooseneck barnacles, including:
- Sperm casting across water columns (long-range reproduction),
- Self-fertilization (pseudo-copulation),
- Movement influenced by wave height (exploration),
- Reproductive selection based on fitness-driven mating allocation (exploitation).

This Python implementation can be easily integrated with machine learning or engineering optimization tasks.

## üìå Features

- Modular and readable Python class for GBO
- Compatible with any user-defined objective function
- Easy integration with machine learning hyperparameter tuning
- Supports boundary constraints and real-coded variables

## üß™ Example Usage

```python
def objective_function(x):
    # Example: Sphere function
    return sum(x**2)

optimizer = GooseneckBarnacleOptimizer(
    obj_func=objective_function,
    lb=[-10]*5, ub=[10]*5,
    dim=5, pop_size=20, max_iter=100
)

best_solution, best_fitness = optimizer.optimize()
print("Best solution:", best_solution)
print("Best fitness:", best_fitness)

## Alternative:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    pop_size = 30
    dimensions = 10
    lb = -10  # lower bound
    ub = 10   # upper bound
    max_iter = 100

    best_position, best_fitness = GBO(objective_function, pop_size, dimensions, lb, ub, max_iter)

    print("Best solution found:")
    print("Position:", best_position)
    print("Fitness:", best_fitness)
